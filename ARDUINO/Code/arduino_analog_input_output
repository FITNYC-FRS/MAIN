ANALOG INPUT/OUTPUT
Use a potentiometer to control the brightness of an LED. 

Insert code below this to create a sketch:

/*
  Analog Input

  Demonstrates analog input by reading an analog sensor on analog pin 0 and
  turning on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital pin 13.
  The amount of time the LED will be on and off depends on the value obtained
  by analogRead().

  The circuit:
  - potentiometer
    center pin of the potentiometer to the analog input 0
    one side pin (either one) to ground
    the other side pin to +5V
  - LED
    anode (long leg) attached to digital output 13
    cathode (short leg) attached to ground

  - Note: because most Arduinos have a built-in LED attached to pin 13 on the
    board, the LED is optional.

int sensorPin = A0;    // select the input pin for the potentiometer
int ledPin = 13;      // select the pin for the LED
int sensorValue = 0;  // variable to store the value coming from the sensor
int brightness = 0; // variable to store the brightness of the LED

void setup() {
  // declare the ledPin as an OUTPUT:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // read the value from the sensor:
  sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);
  
  // map the sensor value to a 0-255 value to adjust the brightness
  brightness = int(map(sensorValue, 0, 1028, 0,255); 

  // adjust the brightness of the LED based on the sensorValue reading
 analogWrite(ledPin, brightness);

delay(100); // delay a tenth to allow the change to take place

*Processing Main - [homepage](https://processing.org)\
Download Processing IDE - [download software](https://processing.org/download)\
Main P5 Website - [p5 home](https://p5js.org)\
P5 Web Editor - [browser based editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)*

*If you are completely new to code based art, Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. P5 is an interpretation of Processing for the web. There is a robust community that is supported by good documentation as well as helpful tutorials and examples to learn from.

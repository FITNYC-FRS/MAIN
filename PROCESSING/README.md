# MAIN PROCESSING/P5 PAGE

Here you will find resources and code for learning how to incorporate Processing technologies into your next project.

If you are completely new to code based art, let's just get some words and phrases defined that might seem confusing, like "processing" and "documentation".

**Processing** is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.

**P5** is an interpretation of Processing for the web.

**Documentation** or reference is the place where you will find definitions of functions(i.e. explanation of code terms) usually including some sample code.

A **sketch** is a project in Processing or P5 and it is a reference to a sketchbook in the way artists develop ideas with a pencil and paper.

Processing and P5 have a robust community that is supported by good documentation as well as helpful tutorials and examples to learn from.

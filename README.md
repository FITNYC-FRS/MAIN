# FITNYC FACULTY RESEARCH SPACE MAIN GITHUB PAGE

FIT's Faculty Research Space is an interdisciplinary lab space intended to foster work across schools, and support a commitment to technology, innovation, and exploration, along with research and development. Faculty can explore on their own, collaborate, and/or bring students into the lab for demonstrations. 

The FRS is staffed by a full-time IT technician with experience in academic and emerging technologies and with a strong skillset in multiple software packages such as Adobe Creative Suite and various 3D software: Rhino, Autodesk Fusion360, SketchUp Pro, etc.

Documentation of the processes and resource materials will be maintained to create a knowledge repository located here on this github.

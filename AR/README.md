# AUGMENTED REALITY MAIN PAGE

Here you will find resources and instructions on how to incorporate Augmented Reality into your next project. 

This particularly is about how to get started with an AR developer called Zappar. There are other platforms to create augmented reality content but those also require some code knowledge. Other content creation tools may be profiled here later but for now, we are aiming to provide an introduction to creating AR content with the lowest barrier of entry for creatives that may not have much experience with emerging technologies or programming.

Basics:
To get started working with Augmented Reality you will need to create a "hobby" account with Zappar:

[Zappar Membership Page](https://zap.works/pricing/) - underneath the pricing models but above the footer is a small section called "Hobby"

This level of membership is free and you can have up to five augmented reality projects at any one time. You may not use this for commercial applications but the generally good part about this method is that unlike an educational license, each hobby account will be yours until you decide. In an educational license, the user is able to assign "seats" and it is actually pretty affordable. **BUT** after the class is over those "seats" must be reallocated to new students and all the work the student has made will be lost. 

**Introduction tutorials:**

There are a few methods or tools to create AR content using Zappar's workflow called Zapworks. 

For super simple content, like business cards or posters or any 2D art integration into an augmented experience, you can use:\
[Zapworks Designer](https://docs.zap.works/designer/getting-started/)\
[Tutorial Page](https://docs.zap.works/designer/tutorials/)

In order to develop content with 3D perspectives, you will need to use:\
[Zapworks Studio](https://docs.zap.works/studio/getting-started/)\
[Tutorial Page](https://docs.zap.works/studio/tutorials/)\
[Project Templates](https://docs.zap.works/studio/project-templates/)

The other tools are more geared toward developers with a more complex strategy that involves other developer apps that generally require some combination of Javascript, html, and game development.
